          The initial idea surrounding this concept was to allow users some
          therapeutic outburst rather than taking that anger or frustration out
          on person or animal. As I researched this concept further I found a
          number of articles talking about children using smart devices, Alexa
          and Google Assistant for example. How these devices are of course
          programmed to listen to your every command and do not require manors,
          nor can they answer in a similar way to user input. It felt as though
          many of us used these devices or programs without care for emotion
          rebuke, which is of course perfectly understandable. This chatbot is
          attempting to partially take on this oddness, being able to analyse
          tones of user input and subsequently fire back in an equally rude and
          abrasive manor.

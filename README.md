This project is still in its prototype phase, though most of the interface is visually completed there are a number of error prevention systems that are currently not inplace. This is explained in more depth in the dedicated blog for this project available here: tumblr.com

In order to use the application in its current form will require you to follow a script for the time being, it does also feature a number of suggested phrases in the chat interface that follow this script. This again is detailed in more depth on the dedicated blog, highlighting why a script was needed for its current prototype stage.

The application is fully hosted on Netlify and is available at the link below for testing. Currently the application is using a lite plan of the Watson Assistant and therefore can only host 2 concurrent sessions at one time. Unfortunately there is no way to currently indicate the amount of users connected to the client. If it continues to crash when visiting the application is it most likely caused by too many users being present. Any crashes or white screens will require a refresh of the page to restart the process.

There is also a video demonstration documenting the use of the script and interaction within the application.

The script is as follows:

For the use of the script you will be playing the role of user. It is also highlighted that Anger Bot will send a response which you must wait for before responding to. In the script you will also see that the messages from Anger Bot are listed as “message” throughout, this is due to the fact it's responses will be varied throughout.

As the user, you will currently be given a number of options throughout, you may pick any one when interacting with Anger Bot.

Anger Bot: Welcome Message
User:
What are you?
What’s your purpose?
Are you real?
How does this work?
Anger Bot: Message
User:
How rude
You’re cheery
Miserable bastard
Anger Bot: Message
User:
Wait is that HAL?
Is that a HAL reference?
Are you HAL 9000?
Dave? You’re not very smart
Who the hell is dave
You suck
You’re a shitty robot
You’re shit
You’re shit to talk to
You’re terrible
Anger Bot: Message
User:
Fuck off
Fuck you
Hahaha you fucking idiot
Shut the fuck up
Stupid fucking robot
You fucking suck
You’re fucking boring
Anger Bot: Message

End of script

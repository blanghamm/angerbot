# Script & Notes on Application

This project is still in its prototype phase, though most of the interface is visually completed there are a number of error prevention systems that are currently not inplace. This is explained in more depth in the dedicated blog for this project available here: https://benlangham-hackspace-individual.tumblr.com/

In order to use the application in its current form will require you to follow a script for the time being, it does also feature a number of suggested phrases in the chat interface that follow this script. This again is detailed in more depth on the dedicated blog, highlighting why a script was needed for its current prototype stage.

The application is fully hosted on Netlify and is available at the link below for testing. Currently the application is using a lite plan of the Watson Assistant and therefore can only host 2 concurrent sessions at one time. Unfortunately there is no way to currently indicate the amount of users connected to the client. If it continues to crash when visiting the application is it most likely caused by too many users being present. Any crashes or white screens will require a refresh of the page to restart the process.

There is also a video demonstration documenting the use of the script and interaction within the application.

## The script is as follows:

_For the use of the script you will be playing the role of user. It is also highlighted that Anger Bot will send a response which you must wait for before responding to. In the script you will also see that the messages from Anger Bot are listed as “message” throughout, this is due to the fact it's responses will be varied throughout._

_As the user, you will currently be given a number of options throughout, you may pick any one when interacting with Anger Bot._

Anger Bot: Welcome Message<br/>
User:<br/>
  * What are you?<br/>
  * What’s your purpose?<br/>
  * Are you real?<br/>
  * How does this work?<br/>
Anger Bot: Message<br/>
User:<br/>
  * How rude<br/>
  * You’re cheery<br/>
  * Miserable bastard<br/>
Anger Bot: Message<br/>
User:<br/>
  * Wait is that HAL?<br/>
  * Is that a HAL reference?<br/>
  * Are you HAL 9000?<br/>
  * Dave? You’re not very smart<br/>
  * Who the hell is dave<br/>
  * You suck<br/>
  * You’re a shitty robot<br/>
  * You’re shit<br/>
  * You’re shit to talk to<br/>
  * You’re terrible<br/>
Anger Bot: Message<br/>
User:<br/>
  * Fuck off<br/>
  * Fuck you<br/>
  * Hahaha you fucking idiot<br/>
  * Shut the fuck up<br/>
  * Stupid fucking robot<br/>
  * You fucking suck<br/>
  * You’re fucking boring<br/>
Anger Bot: Message<br/>

End of script<br/>
